Implementing the structure barplot script from [github.com/mossmatters/Structure_Pipeline]()

This app is currently running at: [http://mossmatters.shinyapps.io/structureplot]()


By default it uses a sample dataset with K = 2. Users can upload their own Q-matrix and customize the colors for each cluster.

If population origin information was part of the analyses, the samples can be sorted (by the fourth column of the Q-matrix). The user can indicate the names of populations.
